Updates: Prepare recordings

		"The update process has been activated. It will take a few minutes.
		The blinking LED indicates that the system is busy. 
		Please, do not press any button, or unplug the Castizer from the mains during the process.
		Once the update is completed, the Castizer will reboot, and you will here my voice again."

		An error occurred during the installation.
		Please, retry later and, if the problem persists, contact your distributor.

		Castizer is not connected to the internet.
		You need to set up a valid internet connection before updating.

		Press again the button if you need instructions to do so: 
			In order to connect Castizer to the internet, you will need a smart device
			You can use a computer, smartphone, tablet, or any other device that allows you
			to browse the internet.
			Fist, make sure your Castizer is plugged in
			Then, take your device, and look for available wifi networks
			The "Castizer" network should be available.
			Connect to it.
			launch a browser, open the address: http:/castizer.local
			and follow the onscreen instructions				

Create Player class.

Error: when there are no playlists...
	Play "There are no playlists" sound

Error: The LED sometimes goes to blinking state

When using concurrently the button and the webserver, the mpd crashes:
	Connection lost while reading line
	retry?

Control errors:
	No playlist exists
	downloading updates: corrupted data, convert to int the value read...

If the lists are random... the pl_current is also played !!!!

Change the logger so that in the format, it automatically prepends the name of the file and function that is doing the log.

Volume in the castizer goes only (effectively) from 0 to 20... scale it somehow?
	For the moment, I have set a limit to 30
	
Volume overflow => play sound to indicate that you reached the limit
	Problem is muxing two audio sources (this sound and the current playing sound)

The save/restore context... should work differently when using streaming stations?

DONE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

---

Update MPD library support:
	The auto_update = yes feature does not seem to be working very well
	keep pressed the Action button (very long) to start update

---

Navigate only through 6 folders/playlists
	Created special mode, selectable with the value of the variable:
		LIMITED_PLAYLIST_CONTROL_BASED_ON_FOLDERS

Mount the second partition of the pendrive, and read the audio files from there.
	Symbolic links have been created

Special button combo is now triggered during:
	PLAY: beeps the alarm
	SLEEP: triggers the update

The volume control:
	If the down button can not be hold... the up button should not do it either... to avoid confusion...
		The volume buttons recognize:
			1 click and more than 1 click events
			hold events do not control volume
	I have set the upper limit for the volume to be 30 (instead of 100)

---	

Add second channel play (copy from castizer_menu original) to save and restore the context.

Integrate the updater so that it is called from the main, with a special combo
	<OK> special combo: Long press in the + button, while the castizer is in sleep state.

Toggle the LED according to the current state
